üßÆ Simple Calculator
A basic Python-based calculator that performs four essential arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This calculator provides a simple command-line interface where users can input numbers and select an operation.

üåü Features
Addition: Adds two numbers.
Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.
Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
Division: Divides the first number by the second, with an error message for division by zero.

Example Interaction

Welcome to the Simple Calculator!
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Choose an operation:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
Enter the operation (1/2/3/4): 1
The result of 10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0


‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling
Division by Zero: If the second number is 0 and division is selected, the calculator will display an error message.
Invalid Operation Choice: If an invalid operation is chosen, the calculator will display an error message.
üîß Future Enhancements
Additional Operations: Add more advanced mathematical functions (e.g., exponentiation, modulus).
Graphical Interface: Implement a GUI for easier interaction.
History Feature: Track past calculations in a session.
